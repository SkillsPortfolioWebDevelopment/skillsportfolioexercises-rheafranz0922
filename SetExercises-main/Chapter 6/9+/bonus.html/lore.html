		<h1> Fiscl Lore</h1>
        <h2>"A mysterious girl who calls herself "Prinzessin der Verurteilung" and travels with a night raven named Oz. Currently serves as an investigator in the Adventurers' Guild.
            Through her unique abilities, eccentric character, and (while she would never admit it herself) hard work, Fischl has become a rising star among the Adventurers' Guild's investigators, earning the recognition of all."</h2>
        <h1>Personality</h1>  
        <h2>
            Due to her upbringing as a child, Fischl is obsessed with fantasy stories and roleplays as a benevolent princess. She speaks in a polite and formal manner to all, 
            which greatly confuses those who interact with her. For this purpose, Oz ends up translating most of her speech if they are confused.
             She is so used to speaking this way that breaking character ends up confusing the people she talks to just as much as staying in character. Fischl has a knack for investigating in part due to her own theories and Oz, which has allowed her to quickly climb up the ranks of the Adventurers' Guild. Even when her ideas sound outlandish, such as claiming a meteor shower to be the result of a curse, Oz is quick to ask others not to underestimate her intuition, as her instincts are very keen.
        </h2>
        <h2>Outside of guild duties, many people view her strangely due to her her antics and roleplay, while this sometimes bothers her, she continues roleplaying regardless because it's her passion. 
            She has very few friends and appreciates those who are willing to go along with her despite her eccentricities.</h2>
        <h2>Outside of roleplaying, she is a kind and well-behaved yet bashful girl. She gets along well with her parents, even if she doesn't spend much time with them or they disagree with some of her decisions. 
            Lisa, who generally gets in a bad mood when people neglect the books they borrow from the library, states that Fischl always keeps the books she borrows in good condition and returns them early. She cares about her friends and peers, even if not particularly close, showing concern about the well-being of her "retinue" 
            (Fellow Adventurers' Guild members). When she unintentionally breaks character or reveals something about herself, she often gets flustered. She tends not to dwell too much on the past, trying to see herself as Fischl, not as her true identity, who she considers a different person, as thinking of her past brings her sadness. Deep down, she can also be quite self-deprecating and insecure, having a hard time taking setbacks well, this can cause her to cling to the escapism and comfort of her persona.</h2>
        <h1>Apearance</h1>
        <h2>Fischl uses the medium female model. She has fair skin and blonde hair that extends to the middle of her back. Her visible eye is light green. 
            Over her left eye, she wears an eyepatch that is almost entirely</h2>
        <h2>covered by her bangs. Fischl styles herself after the titular character of the book Flowers for Princess Fischl.</h2>
