        <h1>Facts</h1>
        
        <h2>Speaking to Fischl is confusing at the best of times as she prefers to speak using both outdated languages and saying things that seem like they jump right out of a fantasy novel. 
         There is a lot to Fischl,and as one may have guessed, that isn't really her name.</h2>
         <h1>She is agent</h1>
         <h2>Fischl seems to be slightly different from the other characters in Mondstadt, who work for the adventurer's guild. Fischl is shown to be on the move around quite a lot and is trusted with handling dangerous situations, like meteorites, that can place her into a temporary coma. She is also seen working on her own, which typically isn't allowed in the guild.
             It seems like Fischl may be more in line with Rosaria and Diluc than she is with actual adventurer's like Bennett.
         </h2>
         <h1>Her Name is Amy</h1>
         <h2>Fischl is not her real name, and she doesn't want anyone to know it. Amy is her real name, but she forbids anyone from knowing about it and even has her name blacked out in her story segments. As far as Fischl is concerned, she was never Amy and would do just about anything to hide her real name.
             Some story elements seem to point to the fact that Fischl will eventually learn to fully accept herself in the future, though.
         </h2>
         <h1>She is an Avid Reader</h1>
         <h2>Fischl's favorite hobby is reading and has been since she was a small child. She loves to spend most of her time in the library, and books helped develop her persona. In fact, there is actually a book about the character that Amy is pretending to be called Flowers For Princess Fischl.
             As it turns out, she even named her partner Oz after a character from a book.
         </h2>
         <h1>She Cares For Her Friends</h1>
         <h2>Despite the fact that Fischl seems unapproachable, she has made friends through the library and the adventurer's guild like Bennett, Noelle also seems to be quite fond of Fischl, believing she is actually famous. 
            She seems unwilling to let them know the truth about her origins though.
        </h2>
        Fischl isn't just another adventure; she actually gathers intelligence for the guild. This is likely why she was so involved with the meteorite event and how she deduces that the Traveler is actually from another world. Fischl is likely highly observant despite her made-up identity.
        While Fischl hasn't been shown doing much other than talking to guards, she may even infiltrate enemy camps.</h2>
